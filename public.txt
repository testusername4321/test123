Redmi Note 7 Pro, the much-awaited smartphone from Xiaomi, will go on sale for the first time in India today. Xiaomi's newest phone will be available via Flipkart, Mi.com, and Mi Home stores at 12pm (Noon) IST and it's safe to assume the sale will get over quickly. To recall, the Redmi Note 7 Pro was launched in the Indian market earlier this month with a dual rear camera setup and a waterdrop-style display notch. The smartphone is also powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 SoC. Alongside the Redmi Note 7 Pro, Xiaomi will also be offering the Redmi Note 7 that went on sale in the country for the first time last week.
